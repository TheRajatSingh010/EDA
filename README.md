# EDA
🍴 Zomato Data Analysis
📌 Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato restaurant dataset to uncover insights about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, pricing trends, and customer preferences.
The notebook zomato-1.ipynb uses Python’s data analysis and visualization libraries to understand patterns in restaurant data and draw meaningful business insights.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw restaurant data.

Analyze location-wise restaurant distribution.

Study relationships between price range, rating, and online ordering.

Visualize cuisines, ratings, and cost patterns.

Derive insights that can help businesses improve visibility and customer satisfaction.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas – data cleaning & manipulation

numpy – numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Zomato Restaurants Data, which contains details like:

Restaurant Name

Location & City

Cuisines

Average Cost for Two

Key Insights (example highlights)

North Indian and Chinese cuisines are among the most popular.

Most restaurants with higher ratings offer online ordering.

Locations like Koramangala and BTM (in Bengaluru dataset) show higher restaurant density.

Moderate price ranges often receive better customer ratings.

🚀 Future Work

Apply machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings.

Build a dashboard using Plotly or Streamlit for interactive analysis.

Integrate live Zomato API data for real-time insights.

📈 Results

Visualizations include:

Distribution of restaurant ratings

Cost comparison by cuisine and location

Correlation heatmaps and category breakdowns

All plots and analyses are presented in the notebook.
